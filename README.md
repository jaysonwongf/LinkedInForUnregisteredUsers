# Overview

A chrome extension that allows you to bypass LinkedIn restriction of viewing only one public profile per unregistered visit. With this extension, you can now view all public profiles you want without registering or signing in.

Just install it and you will be set. Next time you visit LinkedIn, it will remove the popup automatically if you are not logged in.
